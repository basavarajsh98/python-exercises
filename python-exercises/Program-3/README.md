Andrew wants to teach how to open a file and write something in it to his son.
Help him do this by writing a python program.

* If the file doesn't exists, it will throw IOError Exception. Catch it and print a message as
  "Error: can\'t find file or read data. Check the file access mode"

* When wrote something into the file successfully, it should print a message as
  "Written content in the file successfully"

* if cannpt write into the file, print a message as 
  "not writable. Check the file access mode"

* Whether written something into the file or not , it should close the file and print a message as
  "file closed".

Use try, catch and finally to perform the above task.
